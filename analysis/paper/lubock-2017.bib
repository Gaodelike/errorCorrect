  abstract = {Although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes, these suffer from the presence of 1--3 random errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population. The DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full-length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population. We show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) clones from $\sim$60 to >90\% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5- to 4.3-fold to final values of $\sim$1 error per 3500 bp. In addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of GFPuv clones where all members were non-functional, to a population where 82\% of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long DNA sequences.},

  abstract = {The availability of inexpensive, on demand synthetic DNA has enabled numerous powerful applications in biotechnology, in turn driving considerable present interest in the de novo synthesis of increasingly longer DNA constructs. The synthesis of DNA from oligonucleotides into products even as large as small viral genomes has been accomplished. Despite such achievements, the costs and time required to generate such long constructs has, to date, precluded gene-length (and longer) DNA synthesis from being an everyday research tool in the same manner as PCR and DNA sequencing. A critical barrier to low-cost, high-throughput de novo DNA synthesis is the frequency at which errors pervade the final product. Here, we employ a DNA mismatch-binding protein, MutS (from Thermus aquaticus) to remove failure products from synthetic genes. This method reduced errors by >15-fold relative to conventional gene synthesis techniques, yielding DNA with one error per 10\hspace{0.167em}000 base pairs. The approach is general, scalable and can be iterated multiple times for greater fidelity. Reductions in both costs and time required are demonstrated for the synthesis of a 2.5 kb gene.},

  abstract = {The de novo synthesis of genes is becoming increasingly common in synthetic biology studies. However, the inherent error rate (introduced by errors incurred during oligonucleotide synthesis) limits its use in synthesising protein libraries to only short genes. Here we introduce SpeedyGenes, a PCR-based method for the synthesis of diverse protein libraries that includes an error-correction procedure, enabling the efficient synthesis of large genes for use directly in functional screening. First, we demonstrate an accurate gene synthesis method by synthesising and directly screening (without pre-selection) a 747 bp gene for green fluorescent protein (yielding 85% fluorescent colonies) and a larger 1518 bp gene (a monoamine oxidase, producing 76% colonies with full catalytic activity, a 4-fold improvement over previous methods). Secondly, we show that SpeedyGenes can accommodate multiple and combinatorial variant sequences while maintaining efficient enzymatic error correction, which is particularly crucial for larger genes. In its first application for directed evolution, we demonstrate the use of SpeedyGenes in the synthesis and screening of large libraries of MAO-N variants. Using this method, libraries are synthesised, transformed and screened within 3 days. Importantly, as each mutation we introduce is controlled by the oligonucleotide sequence, SpeedyGenes enables the synthesis of large, diverse, yet controlled variant sequences for the purposes of directed evolution.},

  abstract = {The process of DNA mismatch repair is initiated when MutS recognizes mismatched DNA bases and starts the repair cascade. The Escherichia coli MutS protein exists in an equilibrium between dimers and tetramers, which has compromised biophysical analysis. To uncouple these states, we have generated stable dimers and tetramers, respectively. These proteins allowed kinetic analysis of DNA recognition and structural analysis of the full-length protein by X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering. Our structural data reveal that the tetramerization domains are flexible with respect to the body of the protein, resulting in mostly extended structures. Tetrameric MutS has a slow dissociation from DNA, which can be due to occasional bending over and binding DNA in its two binding sites. In contrast, the dimer dissociation is faster, primarily dependent on a combination of the type of mismatch and the flanking sequence. In the presence of ATP, we could distinguish two kinetic groups: DNA sequences where MutS forms sliding clamps and those where sliding clamps are not formed efficiently. Interestingly, this inability to undergo a conformational change rather than mismatch affinity is correlated with mismatch repair.},

  abstract = {Genomic integrity is compromised by DNA polymerase replication errors, which occur in a sequence-dependent manner across the genome. Accurate and complete quantification of a DNA polymerase's error spectrum is challenging because errors are rare and difficult to detect. We report a high-throughput sequencing assay to map in vitro DNA replication errors at the single-molecule level. Unlike previous methods, our assay is able to rapidly detect a large number of polymerase errors at base resolution over any template substrate without quantification bias. To overcome the high error rate of high-throughput sequencing, our assay uses a barcoding strategy in which each replication product is tagged with a unique nucleotide sequence before amplification. This allows multiple sequencing reads of the same product to be compared so that sequencing errors can be found and removed. We demonstrate the ability of our assay to characterize the average error rate, error hotspots and lesion bypass fidelity of several DNA polymerases.},

Incision is on the 3$\prime$-side of the mismatch site in one of the two DNA strands in a heteroduplex. CEL I-like nucleases are found in many plants. We report here that a simple method of enzyme mutation detection using CEL I can efficiently identify mutations and polymorphisms. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, the exons of the BRCA1 gene were amplified by PCR using primers 5$\prime$-labeled with fluorescent dyes of two colors. The PCR products were annealed to form heteroduplexes and subjected to CEL I incision. In GeneScan analyses with a PE Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer, two independent incision events, one in each strand, produce truncated fragments of two colors that complement each other to confirm the position of the mismatch. CEL I can detect 100% of the sequence variants present, including deletions, insertions and missense alterations. Our results indicate that CEL I mutation detection is a highly sensitive method for detecting both polymorphisms and diseasecausing mutations in DNA fragments as long as 1120 bp in length.},

Here, we describe an error correction reaction (ECR), which employs Surveyor, a mismatch-specific DNA endonuclease, to remove errors from synthetic genes. In ECR reactions, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-annealing of the synthetic gene products. Mismatches are recognized and excised by a combination of mismatch-specific endonuclease and 3$\prime$$\rightarrow$5$\prime$ exonuclease activities in the reaction mixture. Finally, overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (OE-PCR) re-assembles the resulting fragments into intact genes. The process can be iterated for increased fidelity. With two iterations, we were able to reduce errors in synthetic genes by >16-fold, yielding a final error rate of $\sim$1 in 8700\hspace{0.167em}bp.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the ability of single-strand specific (sss) nucleases from different sources to cleave single base pair mismatches in heteroduplex DNA templates used for mutation and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) mismatch cleavage protocol was used with the LI-COR gel detection system to assay cleavage of amplified heteroduplexes derived from a variety of induced mutations and naturally occurring polymorphisms. We found that purified nucleases derived from celery (CEL I), mung bean sprouts and Aspergillus (S1) were able to specifically cleave nearly all single base pair mismatches tested. Optimal nicking of heteroduplexes for mismatch detection was achieved using higher pH, temperature and divalent cation conditions than are routinely used for digestion of single-stranded DNA. Surprisingly, crude plant extracts performed as well as the highly purified preparations for this application. These observations suggest that diverse members of the S1 family of sss nucleases act similarly in cleaving non-specifically at bulges in heteroduplexes, and single-base mismatches are the least accessible because they present the smallest single-stranded region for enzyme binding. We conclude that a variety of sss nucleases and extracts can be effectively used for high-throughput mutation and polymorphism discovery.},

  abstract  = {Efficient screening of unknown DNA variations is one of the substantive matters of molecular biology even today. Historically, SSCP and heteroduplex analysis (HA) are the most commonly used methods for detecting DNA variations everywhere in the world because of their simplicity. However, the sensitivity of these methods is not satisfactory for screening purpose. Recently, several new PCR-based mutation screening methods have been developed, but most of them require special instruments and adjustment of conditions for each DNA sequence to attain the maximum sensitivity, eventually becoming as inconvenient as old methods. Enzyme mismatch cleavage (EMC) is potentially an ideal screening method. With high-performance nucleases and once experimental conditions are optimized, it requires only conventional staff and conditions remain the same for each PCR product. In this study we tested four commercially available endonucleases for EMC and optimized the electrophoresis and developing conditions. We prepared 25 known DNA variations consisting of 18 single base substitutions (8 transitions and 10 transversions, including all possible sets of mismatches) and 7 small deletions or insertions. The combination of CEL nuclease, 12% PAGE and rapid silver staining can detect all types of mutations and achieved 100% sensitivity.},

  abstract = {The development of economical de novo gene synthesis methods using microchip-synthesized oligonucleotides has been limited by their high error rates. In this study, a low-cost, effective and improved-throughput (up to 32 oligos per run) error-removal method using an immobilized cellulose column containing the mismatch binding protein MutS was produced to generate high-quality DNA from oligos, particularly microchip-synthesized oligonucleotides. Error-containing DNA in the initial material was specifically retained on the MutS-immobilized cellulose column (MICC), and error-depleted DNA in the eluate was collected for downstream gene assembly. Significantly, this method improved a population of synthetic enhanced green fluorescent protein (720 bp) clones from 0.93% to 83.22%, corresponding to a decrease in the error frequency of synthetic gene from 11.44/kb to 0.46/kb. In addition, a parallel multiplex MICC error-removal strategy was also evaluated in assembling 11 genes encoding $\sim$21 kb of DNA from 893 oligos. The error frequency was reduced by 21.59-fold (from 14.25/kb to 0.66/kb), resulting in a 24.48-fold increase in the percentage of error-free assembled fragments (from 3.23% to 79.07%). Furthermore, the standard MICC error-removal process could be completed within 1.5 h at a cost as low as $0.374 per MICC.},

  abstract = {Large DNA constructs of arbitrary sequences can currently be assembled with relative ease by joining short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (oligonucleotides). The ability to mass produce these synthetic genes readily will have a significant impact on research in biology and medicine. Presently, high-throughput gene synthesis is unlikely, due to the limits of oligonucleotide synthesis. We describe a microfluidic PicoArray method for the simultaneous synthesis and purification of oligonucleotides that are designed for multiplex gene synthesis. Given the demand for highly pure oligonucleotides in gene synthesis processes, we used a model to improve key reaction steps in DNA synthesis. The oligonucleotides obtained were successfully used in ligation under thermal cycling conditions to generate DNA constructs of several hundreds of base pairs. Protein expression using the gene thus synthesized was demonstrated. We used a DNA assembly strategy, i.e. ligation followed by fusion PCR, and achieved effective assembling of up to 10 kb DNA constructs. These results illustrate the potential of microfluidics-based ultra-fast oligonucleotide parallel synthesis as an enabling tool for modern synthetic biology applications, such as the construction of genome-scale molecular clones and cell-free large scale protein expression.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {Genome editing using engineered nucleases is used for targeted mutagenesis. But because genome editing does not target all loci with similar efficiencies, the mutation hit-rate at a given locus needs to be evaluated. The analysis of mutants obtained using engineered nucleases requires specific methods for mutation detection, and the Enzyme Mismatch Cleavage method is commonly used for this purpose. This method uses enzymes that cleave heteroduplex DNA at mismatches and extrahelical loops formed by single or multiple nucleotides. Bacteriophage resolvases and single-stranded nucleases are commonly used in the assay, but have not been compared side-by-side on mutations obtained by engineered nucleases. We present the first comparison of the sensitivity of T7E1 and Surveyor EMC assays on deletions and point mutations obtained by zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) targeting in frog embryos. We report the mutation detection limits and efficiencies of T7E1 and Surveyor. In addition, we find that T7E1 outperforms the Surveyor nuclease in terms of sensitivity with deletion substrates, whereas Surveyor is better for detecting single nucleotide changes. We conclude that T7E1 is the preferred enzyme to scan mutations triggered by engineered nucleases.},
